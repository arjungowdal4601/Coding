# 💳 Credit Risk Modelling 📈🔍

Welcome to the **Credit Risk Modelling** project! This repository contains a **machine learning model** that predicts the risk of loan default based on user-provided financial data. The project integrates **logistic regression**, **feature engineering**, and **data preprocessing** into a **Streamlit-powered UI** for real-time risk assessment.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Real-Time Risk Prediction:**  
Users can input their financial details and get an instant **credit risk score** and **default probability**.

✅ **Machine Learning Model:**  
Uses **logistic regression** trained on historical loan performance data.

✅ **Feature Engineering & Scaling:**  
Handles **loan-to-income ratio**, **delinquency ratio**, and **credit utilization ratio** dynamically.

✅ **User-Friendly UI:**  
A clean **Streamlit interface** makes it easy to use, even for non-technical users.

✅ **Deployment Ready:**  
Can be deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud** or any cloud service.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
  Or install required libraries manually:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit joblib pandas scikit-learn numpy
  ```

### Running the Application

1. **Ensure Artifacts are Ready:**  
   Verify that the `artifacts/` folder contains:
   - `model_data.joblib`
   - `scaler.joblib`

2. **Start the App:**  
   Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open in Browser:**  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the credit risk predictor.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Data:**  
   Users enter personal and financial details such as **age, income, loan amount, credit utilization, and delinquency ratio**.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - **Loan-to-Income Ratio** = `Loan Amount / Income`
   - **Delinquency Ratio** = `Delinquent Months / Total Loan Months`
   - **Credit Utilization Ratio** is processed dynamically.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - The input data is **scaled using MinMaxScaler** (pre-trained on past financial data).
   - **Categorical variables** (e.g., residence type, loan type) are **one-hot encoded**.

4. **Risk Prediction:**  
   - The processed data is passed to the **logistic regression model**.
   - The model computes **default probability** and assigns a **credit score (300-900)**.

5. **Results Display:**  
   - **Default Probability (% chance of defaulting on loan)**
   - **Credit Score (300-900)**
   - **Risk Rating (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent)**

## 🔬 Model Training

If you need to re-train the model:

### **Step 1: Preprocess Data**
Ensure all necessary features are correctly engineered and scaled. If removing or adding features, update `features` in `prediction_helper.py`.

### **Step 2: Train the Model**
Use logistic regression or another classifier:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **Step 3: Save Model & Scaler**
Store them in the `artifacts/` directory:

```python
from joblib import dump

dump(model, "artifacts/model_data.joblib")
dump({"scaler": scaler, "cols_to_scale": cols_to_scale}, "artifacts/scaler.joblib")
```
